Project Overview
For your final project, you will create a Python application that integrates data from two different free APIs and writes the combined data to a spreadsheet using the Openpyxl library. This project aims to give you hands-on experience with working with APIs, processing data, and utilizing Openpyxl for spreadsheet manipulation.

Project Requirements
Choose Two Free APIs:

Select two free APIs that provide data you find interesting. You can find free APIs at websites like publicapis.ioLinks to an external site. or programmableweb.comLinks to an external site..
Ensure that the APIs do not require authentication, or if they do, make sure you understand how to handle the authentication process.
Interact with APIs:

Write Python code to fetch data from the chosen APIs.
Ensure that the data is relevant and can be combined in some meaningful way.
Data Interaction:

Process the data from the two APIs so that they interact. For example, you might combine weather data with location data, match currency exchange rates with country information, or correlate movie ratings with release dates.
Think creatively about how the data can be combined to provide useful or interesting insights.
Write to Spreadsheet:

Use the Openpyxl library to write the combined data into an Excel spreadsheet.
Organize the data in a clear and readable format. Use different sheets if necessary to separate raw data from processed data.
Include headers and ensure the data is formatted neatly.
Suggested Steps
Set Up Your Environment:

Ensure you have Python installed.
Install the necessary libraries: openpyxl, requests, etc.
pip install openpyxl requests
Choose and Explore APIs:

Browse through available APIs and choose two that interest you.
Read the API documentation to understand how to fetch data.
Fetch Data from APIs:

Write Python functions to fetch data from the two APIs.
Test the functions to ensure you are getting the expected data.
Process and Combine Data:

Write functions to process the data and combine it in a meaningful way.
Ensure that the combined data makes sense and provides useful insights.
Write Data to Excel:

Use Openpyxl to create a new Excel workbook.
Write the combined data to the spreadsheet, ensuring proper formatting.
Add Enhancements (Optional):

Add charts or graphs to visualize the data.
Implement additional features that make your project stand out.
Example Project Idea
Project Title: "Weather and Air Quality Analysis"

APIs:

Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
Air Quality API (e.g., AQICN)
Description:

Fetch weather data (temperature, humidity, etc.) for various cities.
Fetch air quality data (AQI, pollutants, etc.) for the same cities.
Combine the data to analyze the relationship between weather conditions and air quality.
Spreadsheet:

Sheet 1: Raw Weather Data
Sheet 2: Raw Air Quality Data
Sheet 3: Combined Data with Analysis
Add charts to visualize the correlation between weather conditions and air quality.
